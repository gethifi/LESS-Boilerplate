# LESS Boilerplate

This is a collection of LESS styles and helpers that provides a starting point when creating a new website.

## Getting Started

Each file will work on its own or as a part of the entire boilerplate. However, it is necessary to provide several important configuration settings at the top of these files:

### grid.less

* @column-width (default = 60px)
* @gutter-width (default = 20px)
* @columns (default = 12)

### spacing.less

* @baseline (default = 20px)

### typography.less

* @baseline (default = 20px)

## Coding Style

* Indent with 4 spaces (do not use tabs)
* Comments are written in C style
* Variable, mixin, operator, and function names should:
    * Use lower-case characters
    * Use dashes to separate words
